- The dashboard presents various insights related to Airbnb listings. It provides visuals to analyze the relationship between listing attributes (like bedroom count and location) and their impact on price and revenue.

### VISUALIZATIONS:

- Average Price per Bedroom: A bar chart that breaks down the average price of Airbnb listings based on the number of bedrooms. The data shows that as the number of bedrooms increases, the average price tends to rise, with one-bedroom properties having an average price of $96.2 and six-bedroom properties priced at $584.8 on average.

- Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings: A table showing the distinct count of listings by bedroom count. One-bedroom listings dominate the market, with 1,811 properties, while six-bedroom properties are the rarest, with only five listings.

- Price by Zipcode (Map and Bar Chart): Two visualizations showing the distribution of prices across various zip codes in the region. The map highlights the average price geographically, while the bar chart ranks zip codes by price. Zip code 98199 has the highest average price ($200), while 98133 shows the lowest ($50).

- Revenue Over the Year: A line graph that tracks the total revenue throughout the year 2016, showing steady growth over time, peaking toward the end of the year.

### INSIGHTS

- **Bedroom Influence on Pricing:** The chart shows a clear trend that as the number of bedrooms increases, so does the average price, reflecting the value larger properties hold in the Airbnb market.
  
- **Listings Distribution:** The market is dominated by smaller properties, especially one-bedroom listings, indicating a higher supply of smaller accommodations.
  
- **Geographical Price Variation:** Zip code 98199 stands out with the highest average listing price, which could indicate it’s a more premium area for Airbnb, while 98133 represents more budget-friendly listings.
  
- **Revenue Growth:** The consistent increase in revenue over the year suggests that the Airbnb market was growing throughout 2016, possibly driven by demand for holiday stays towards the year’s end.

  
- **In summary, this dashboard helps Airbnb hosts and property managers optimize pricing strategies, identify market opportunities, and predict seasonal demand patterns, ultimately driving more informed and profitable decisions.**
